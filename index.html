	    Hello. My name is Raj Patil. I am a physicist working on modelling of gravitational waves emitted by compact objects. <br> <br>

	    Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Albert Einstein Institute and Humboldt University. I am working here under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Alessandra Buonanno and Dr. Jan Steinhoff on modelling compact objects and their effect on emitted gravitational waves. <br> <br> 
	    
	    Before this, I did my bachelor's and master's in physics from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune. My master's thesis was under the guidance of Dr. Suneeta Vardarajan on studying the effective field approach to the two body problem in gravity.

	  <!--	  <p> For a general reader, what we do is best explained by the following analogy by Prof. Richard Feynman:
	    <h5>“…a fun analogy in trying to get some idea of what we’re doing in trying to understand nature, is to imagine that the gods are playing some great game like chess… and you don’t know the rules of the game, but you’re allowed to look at the board, at least from time to time… and from these observations you try to figure out what the rules of the game are, what the rules of the pieces moving are. You might discover after a bit, for example, that when there’s only one bishop around on the board that the bishop maintains its color. Later on you might discover the law for the bishop as it moves on the diagonal, which would explain the law that you understood before – that it maintained its color – and that would be analogous to discovering one law and then later finding a deeper understanding of it. Then things can happen, everything’s going good, and then all of a sudden some strange phenomenon occurs in some corner, so you begin to investigate that – it’s castling, something you didn’t expect. We’re always, by the way, in fundamental physics, always trying to investigate those things in which we don’t understand the conclusions. After we’ve checked them enough, we’re okay.
	      
	      The thing that doesn’t fit is the thing that’s most interesting, the part that doesn’t go according to what you expected. Also, we could have revolutions in physics: after you’ve noticed that the bishops maintain their color and they go along the diagonal and so on for such a long time and then everybody knows that that’s true, then you suddenly discover one day in some chess game that the bishop doesn’t maintain its color, it changes its color. Only later do you discover a new possibility, that a bishop is captured and that a pawn went all the way down to the queen’s end to produce a new bishop – that can happen but you didn’t know it, and so it’s very analogous to the way our laws are: They sometimes look positive, they keep on working and all of a sudden some little gimmick shows that they’re wrong and then we have to investigate the conditions under which this bishop change of color happened and so forth, and gradually learn the new rule that explains it more deeply.
	      
	      Unlike the chess game, though, in which the rules become more complicated as you go along, in physics, when you discover new things, it looks more simple. It appears on the whole to be more complicated because we learn about a greater experience – that is, we learn about more particles and new things – and so the laws look complicated again. But if you realize all the time what’s kind of wonderful – that is, if we expand our experience into wilder and wilder regions of experience – every once in a while we have these integrations when everything’s pulled together into a unification, in which it turns out to be simpler than it looked before."

	    The observations by Galileo through his telescopes opened new horizons in our understanding of the cosmos. It allowed us to see celestial objects in ways previously unimaginable, revealing moons around Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and much more. Similarly, the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 has started a new era of astronomical exploration. It allows us to observe cosmic phenomena, such as black hole mergers and neutron star collisions, that were once beyond our reach, fundamentally altering our understanding of the universe.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The question I aim to address is the following: When two objects such as black holes and/or neutron stars, undergo a binary coalescence, they emit gravitational waves. We detect these waves using our amazing detectors. What information can we obtain about the properties of the two colliding objects by analyzing the detected gravitational waves? Specifically, what insights can we gain about their mass, spin, equation of state, their surroundings, and so on?

	  <p> Currently, I work on the studying astrophysical compact objects and gravitational waves emitted by them using the techniques of quantum field theories and scattering amplitudes. This problem is interesting because the recent direct detections of gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo observatories have proved to be a probe for the physics of celestial objects like black holes and neutron stars. Such detections have the potential to unravel the mysteries of cosmic origins, equations of state of compact objects and will prove to be a test to the theory of general relativity. On the other hand, the framework of Quantum field  theory has proven to be very successful at predicting physical behavior to high accuracy and precision and is the basic language of modern theoretical physics. Moreover, the techniques of scattering amplitudes provide us with several tools which make the calculation of the physical observables systematic and insightful.

	  <p> In my <a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/4705?mode=simple" target="_blank">master's thesis</a>,
	    <!-- under the guidance of  Dr. Suneeta Vardarajan at IISER Pune, -->
	    I studied the method of Effective Field Theories (EFT) used to model the gravitational waves emitted by various binary sources. Such sources, due to their non-relativistic nature, are analytically studied using the techniques of post-Newtonian (PN) approximation by perturbatively expanding in orders of orbital velocity over the speed of light. I followed the calculation of Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann (EIH) Lagrangian, which is the 1PN correction to the two body gravitational potential. Then, to consider the effects of the electromagnetic charge of the constituents of the binary system, I newly derived the corrections to this 1PN potential by adding photons in the formalism which can be found here <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11107" target="_blank">[arXiv:2009.11107]</a>. To study the effects of the spin of binary constituents on the waveform, I reviewed the calculation of the Spin-Spin, Spin-Orbit, and Spin-squared effective potentials up to 2PN. I also followed the calculation of the Burke-Thorne radiation reaction force at 2.5 PN, using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism of open quantum field theories.

	  <p>Currently, for my Ph.D. thesis, I am working
	    <!-- with Dr. Manoj Mandal, Prof. Dr. Pierpaolo Mastrolia, and Dr. Jan Steinhoff -->
	    on computing state-of-the-art higher-order effective potentials. Such potentials are important as they are used to compute accurate theoretical waveform templates which are compulsory ingredients for data analysis and reliable physical interpretation of the gravitational wave signals. I am developing a fast and efficient Mathematica routine for the automatic computation of Feynman diagrams and the corresponding integrals using the multi-loop techniques of quantum field theories <a href="https://indico.phys.ethz.ch/event/22/timetable/#60-spinning-compact-objects-us" target="_blank">[Poster at QCDmeetsGravity2022]</a>. Using this I have performed the following analyses:

	    Astrophysical black holes and neutron stars usually have a non-zero angular momentum and this "spin" has a huge impact on the emitted gravitational waves. The effects of spin can be characterised as follows. The spin-orbit sector is analogous to the fine structure correction obtained to the hydrogen atom, which describe the interaction between the orbital angular momentum of the binary and the spin of one of its constituents. Whereas, the quadratic in spin are analogous to the hyperfine structure corrections to the hydrogen atom and describe the interaction between each other/self of the spins of the binary constituents. I have computed the effective Hamiltonians at 4.5PN and 5PN, that describe the effect of spin of the constituents on the binary dynamics, thus on the emitted gravitational waves.

	    Neutron stars feature a number of oscillation modes, and to understand them we can picture a basic stellar model that consists of the continuity equation (conservation of mass), Euler’s equation (equation of motion for the fluid elements), Poisson’s equation (that determines the gravitational force from the matter distribution), and the equation-of-state (that describes how pressure and density are related). With these elements combined, we can describe a star in equilibrium, which we can then perturb. The lowest frequency normal mode of perturbed oscillation is known as the fundamental mode (f-mode), which is one of the dominant modes in the context of tidal excitation. I have computed the effective Hamiltonians at 2PN and 3PN, that describe the effect of such tidal f-mode oscillations on the binary dynamics, thus on the emitted gravitational waves.

	    Another recently developed method used in the modeling of the spinning compact objects is the scattering amplitudes of massive higher spinning particles. Specifically, spin structure of a Kerr black hole up to the 2^(2s)-multipole is reproduced by considering the scattering of massive spin-s particles which are minimally coupled to gravity. In this direction, I have worked -->
	    <!-- with Dr. Arnab Rudra, where we developed -->
	  <!--  on developing a method <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05301" target="_blank">[arXiv:2106.05301]</a> to efficiently compute tree-level amplitudes of photon and graviton four-point functions with massive higher spin exchanges. These scattering amplitudes can be then used to compute physical observables for scattering of two Kerr black holes, like momentum transferred or impulse, momentum radiated as radiation, and binding potential with more precision.
